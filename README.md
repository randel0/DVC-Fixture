Dual voice card test fixture for Rhodes Chroma

This is a test fixture that emulates the analog control voltage sample-and-hold bank and data latches of the Rhodes Chroma dual channel voice board. It also provides LED status of many latched bits, as well as a convenient pass through of all functions to test points located at the top of the card.

Gerber files and KiCad files are available in the repository.
